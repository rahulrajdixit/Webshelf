# Webshelf
Webshelf is a simple website I tried building using html, css, and javascript totally from scratch. The Idea behind the website was to serve as a platform, where the most popular websites, web-applications and tools can be grouped together, based on their field. Example: A section focused on "Coding" would have a collection of websites such as: GeeksforGeeks, Tutorialspoint, GitHub, etc..

The website also surves as an Onine Shelf of all the simple web applications I develop. Currently the website has 2 web applications build by me:-
> 1) Archade Tennis
> 2) WhatsMyTask
