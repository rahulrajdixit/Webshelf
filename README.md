Webshelf is a simple website I tried building using html, css, and javascript totally from scratch. The idea behind the website was to serve as a platform, where the most popular websites, web-applications and tools can be grouped together, based on their field. Example: A section focused on "Coding" would have a collection of websites such as: GeeksforGeeks, Tutorialspoint, GitHub, etc..

The website also serves as an Online Shelf of all the simple Web-Applications I had developed/developing. Currently the website has 2 Web Applications build by me:-
1. Archade Tennis
2. WhatsMyTask

## **Features**
- Groups different websites based on the audience and usage.
- Made from scratch without any framework and dependencies.
- The site does not need any backend to operate.
- Has Web-Applications such as:- 
> 1. WhatsMyTask: https://rahulrajdixit.github.io/Webshelf/WhatsMyTask/whatsmytask.html
> 2. Arcade Tennis: https://rahulrajdixit.github.io/Webshelf/arcade_tennis.html
