# Webshelf

## **Please Note**
- Please feel free to make contribute to this project.
- Its an indexing website for popular websites, and still a lot of websites need to be added.
- The site or the custom applications that are developed don't need any backend functionality.


## **Introduction**
Webshelf is a simple website I tried building using html, css, and javascript totally from scratch. The Idea behind the website was to serve as a platform, where the most popular websites, web-applications and tools can be grouped together, based on their field. Example: A section focused on "Coding" would have a collection of websites such as: GeeksforGeeks, Tutorialspoint, GitHub, etc..

The website also surves as an Onine Shelf of all the simple Web Applications I had developed. Currently the website has 2 web applications build by me:-
1. Archade Tennis
2. WhatsMyTask

## **Features**
- Groups different websites based on the audience and usage.
- Made from scratch without any dependencies.
- The site does not need any backend to operate.
- Has Web-Applications such as:- 
> 1. WhatsMyTask: https://rahulrajdixit.github.io/Webshelf/WhatsMyTask/whatsmytask.html
> 2. Arcade Tennis: https://rahulrajdixit.github.io/Webshelf/arcade_tennis.html
